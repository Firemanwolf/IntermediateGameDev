After reading the door problem, I think in which the designer, composer, level designer, and writer all sounds so fun to me. I definitely love to create a system for door opening, but I also would like to compose the reaction of the character that the player is controlling. I then would like to use this system to create the level to contextualize such system waiting for the players to interact with, but then I'm also would love to create an awesome theme piece for my games that might hype the players while playing it.I don't really like anything relevant to art as my drawing is terrible, but still I'm interested in the working content as an artist. Publisher or PR or whatever seems a bit boring,I don't like jobs that are irrelevant to making game. Actually I don't know if working in the industry would be the best choice for me, as I would be afraid that I ended up doing repetitive job that I don't like, my ideal job is just designing, but in order to get in that position I might need to spend lots of time while still not getting it. Other than making game, I'm also interested in composing song, singing, acting, or just writing story which are all relevant to what jobs I interested above. I think this might also be a reason that I like game designing as I can do all the things I passionate with at once.
I think the programming part is actually pretty boring from my view...all they are doing is just fulfilling the requirements that others are raising, not much creative sides involve in this aspect, I personally like to create new things instead of just completing a task.

This week's task has been a tough one, the requirement of exploration game without the collisionns have really made my development progress disastrorous, I've designed many mechanisms that end up realizing that it needs the colliders: I've tried to make a puzzle game where the players have to find their way out with limited view and complete darkness but then I realize the interaction with the item seems to be impossible without the collisionsTrigger. Then I said well maybe the players can somehow control each component of a painting layer by layer to move them and eventually make a fine art painting, but then I realize to detect where each layer should land will also need to rely on the collision.So finally here it goes, I've come up with the idea of by moving the camera will enlarge the background and eventually will ge to see the full picture as a reward. But my drawing skill is just awful so I basically just made a starry night.. I've put my most of the efforts into the 2 animations but somehow when I exported them they were sort of blurry? Not sure why.I was still going to retain the idea of different layers of background and move relatively with the player but the art materials that I currently have does not sustain to manifest such effects. Maybe next time when I get better on my drawing... The drawing is just my nightmare that I refused to mention.
