After reading the door problem, I think in which the designer, composer, level designer, and writer all sounds so fun to me. I definitely love to create a system for door opening, but I also would like to compose the reaction of the character that the player is controlling. I then would like to use this system to create the level to contextualize such system waiting for the players to interact with, but then I'm also would love to create an awesome theme piece for my games that might hype the players while playing it.I don't really like anything relevant to art as my drawing is terrible, but still I'm interested in the working content as an artist. Publisher or PR or whatever seems a bit boring,I don't like jobs that are irrelevant to making game. Actually I don't know if working in the industry would be the best choice for me, as I would be afraid that I ended up doing repetitive job that I don't like, my ideal job is just designing, but in order to get in that position I might need to spend lots of time while still not getting it. Other than making game, I'm also interested in composing song, singing, acting, or just writing story which are all relevant to what jobs I interested above. I think this might also be a reason that I like game designing as I can do all the things I passionate with at once.
I think the programming part is actually pretty boring from my view...all they are doing is just fulfilling the requirements that others are raising, not much creative sides involve in this aspect, I personally like to create new things instead of just completing a task.
